# Python-project

The idea of this project is to create an application which allows the user to play music using GUI. The application will include functions so the user can select the song, pause it, play it, and go to the previous one or next one.libraries like Tkinter and pygame will be use for creating the user interface and play with the buttoms and play the the songs, and os so the code can access to the files inside the computer.
The basic structure of the code will be:

1) Libraries:
   tkinter for creating user interface and create the directory for the songs
   pygame for creating buttons to intercat with and play the music
   os for accessing files inside the computer
   pillow library which helps to avoid possible problems with loading images

2) functions:
   music loader: allows us to load music files into a list
   play: start music
   stop: stop music
   previous: previous song
   next: next song

3) other functionalities
   Block of code which allows us to start the emergent window
   block of code for reading from the computer images and put them in the emergent window
   block of code that creates a menu bar for accessing the directory
