# Python-project
A music player programmed in python. the functionality of this project is create a program which allows the user to reproduce music and interact with a CLI or GUI (as the project is build will be clarified which one is more convenient) the methods and all code will be directed in creating an interface in which the user can click on buttoms for next song, previous song, stop, play, select song and basic functionalities so the interface is manageable for the user.the main library will be tkinter used for developing a GUI but also pygame will be required for playing with the buttoms and possibly pydub for playing the music.Since the project is not started the development could vary a lot but the main base which will catch up to the final version will incude functions which allow us to include buttoms for pausing the video, resume the video, also I want to let the user choose between a list of songs and see images. since we want to implement OOP we could implement classes related with functionalities and then work the related functions. so for example we can do a class for buttoms, so all functions related with buttoms will be included, or a class for song lists so we can do the code that allows us to store the songs. In this way we will have a more ordered code so instead of check function by function we could find the specific class and have a better organization of functions the main inspiration of this project are apps like spotify.
the main organization of the code should be:
1) function for adding song
2) function for delete song
3) function for play song
4) functions for pause soog
5) function that allow us to browse the catalog
6) function that allows us to reproduce the previus song
7) function that allow us to reproduce next song
8) function that allows us to store a music catalog
these are the basic functions that the music player should have, the libraries like tkink will allow us to create the user interface and play the audio file.
